###This exercise write tests and codes to pass the test. (Tests are written with Jasmine)</p>

* Create a function called aritGeo that takes one argument, an Array. 
You are required to check if the array passed as an argument is arithmetic, geometric, neither arithmetic nor geometric in progression or 
if the array is empty.
For arithmetic progressions, return Arithmetic
For geometric progressions, return Geometric
For neither of the above, return -1
For an empty array, return 0.

* Write a function to find the maximum and minimum elements of an array. Your answer should be returned in an array containing the min and 
max number, respectively.

* Create a function fizzBuzz to return 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz', or the argument it receives, all depending on the argument of the 
function, a number that is divisible by, 3, 5, or both 3 and 5, respectively. When the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the number 
itself should be returned.
